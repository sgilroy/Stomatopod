Stomatopod
==========

Stomatopod is a system for controlling multiple wearable synchronized RGB LED strips
connected wirelessly and manipulated by force sensitive resistors (FSRs) and other
sensors and controls. The original system was designed for two shoe-worn nodes,
plus a backpack node. Each node is a combination of an Arduino board, addressable
RBG LED strip, a ZigBee, and some sensors/controls.

This project takes its name from Stomatopods (also known as mantis shrimp) which
have the most complex and sensitive visual systems of any organism on earth.
The eyes of stomatopods have 16 different visual pigments (compared to just three
in humans) allowing them to see a variety of colors and nuances of light well beyond
that of other creatures.
